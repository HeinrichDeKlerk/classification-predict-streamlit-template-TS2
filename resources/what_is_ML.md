##### By definition, Machine learning provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

We will focus on a Machine Learning method called Classification.
 >A sub-category of Supervised Learning, Classification is the process of taking some sort of input and assigning a label to it. Classification systems are usually used when predictions are of a discrete, or "yes or no" nature. Example: Mapping a picture of someone to a male or female classification.
 
 Or, in this case, labeling a twitter message's sentiment towards climate change.
